# LiveCodingChallenge-MarlonMichaelSebastian
This GitHub repository showcases Daniel Shiffman's Coding Challenge creating a ray casting program with additional creative refactors made by our group. This includes...
- Collision
- Movement Additions
- Additional Rendering

Implementing these creative refactors allows us to further deepen our connection and understanding of the code, instead of solely copying as it it requires knowing the code works in order to properly implement the refactors. This cultivates learning as when we work through the coding challenge, we can gain a sense of how the different components of the code work together to create a product. 

This Repository also includes the different versions of the coding challenge as we worked through it, transitioning from 2D raycasting to rendering a 3D view.
